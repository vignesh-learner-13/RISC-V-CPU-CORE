Design RV32I CPU Core using Verilog
-----------------------------------
This repository contains the design and implementation of a RISC-V CPU core using Verilog HDL.
The CPU core is based on the RV32I base instruction set architecture (ISA), which is a 32-bit RISC-V ISA supporting integer operations
